# block15-Froyo-Survey

After an initial meeting, the management team has decided they want to collect the following information. As a test case, you have your friend Jake complete the survey. Using what we know about JavaScript objects, create an object labeled customer and add the following key:value pairs.


As you review the survey draft with the management team, they have decided to remove a couple of items from the survey. Delete the following properties in the customer object using the delete keyword.
zipCode
favoriteStore

The management team also wants to add the following items to the survey: toppings, future flavors, and today's purchase cost. You check with Jake, and he provides the other bits of information you need to add these keys. Add the following key:values to the customer object using dot notation:
toppings: "chocolate sprinkles", "wafer straws", and "gummy bears"
futureFlavors: "mango"
todaysPurchaseCost: 5.32

Before you finalize the survey, you decide to check your survey one last time. In an array, print the keys in your survey. You should have the following:
firstName
lastName
email
phone
favoriteFlavors
cupSize
firstVisit
toppings
futureFlavors
todaysPurchaseCost
